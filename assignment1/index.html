        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?/ Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of
        each of your discrete actions.

        What was immediately clear was that the page has a lot of information
        due to the large amount of elements, Layout wise its disorientating due
        to the margin's not having seperate background colours, My attention was
        drawn to the advent calendar on the left and the opening tabs done by
        left clicking with your mouse.

        In terms of my action upon using the website for a short amount of time
        <br />
        <br />
        -Upon opening the site for the first time I immediately was drawn to the
        advent calendar on the left side of the site. Interacting with it allows
        the user to open the tabs that have moveable elements underneath them.
        <br />
        <br />
        -This was followed by reading the text in the center lane of the screen
        that describes the purpose of the sight with a simple title/heading
        followed by body text.
        <br />
        <br />
        -The images on the right of the screen had numbers beneath them that
        allowed the user to interact with and cycle through images.
        <br />
        <br />
        -I only near the end of my experience i realized that there more content
        that required scrolling to access
        <br />
        <br />

      <li>
        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with/
        What was the most common action<br />
        in your two minute interaction with the experience/ What is your
        impression of the intended primary goal <br />
        of the interactive experience and How does the interactive experience
        communicate this primary goal?
      </li>
      <br />
      <body>
        By far the most engaging area on the website is the advent calendar on
        the left as it takes up a major part of the screen and has colourful
        images that due to their design/placement are meant to interact with in
        stark contrast to the black and white colours the rest of the page
        exhbits. This led to me opening all the calendar tabs multiple times
        which is likely due to the uniqueness of the element. Most websites have
        text and images so an intractable calendar on the left immediately
        stands out as something different that you want to try. The text states
        that the website is a digital portfolio that has attempted to express
        the creators projects/body of work in a unique way through the use of
        the calender and interacting with elements to prevent skim reading and
        attempt to retain the reader's attention.
      </body>
      <br />
      <br />
      <li>
        What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
        over time? (For how long and how many different times), How does the
        interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over
        time? What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </li>
      <br />

      <body>
        The unique design of the website gives it a lot of potential to come
        back to after your first time using the site, However the site loses its
        novelty quickly so I think it's unlikely that someone would willingly
        return to the site multiple times. The site uses gifs to display
        information on the side site. The website attempts to communicate its
        information in a way that is engaging however it is unlikely to be
        revisited by users.

        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
        when engaging with your research experience What does this reference/s
        communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your
        research experience
      </li>
      <br />
      <body>
        While the site is likely to still be interacted with in a top down
        procedure like normal its calender and numbered gifs on the side add
        that also may make each users journey through the experience unique,
        This is a effective way of reaching through to the user and attempting
        to leave a lasting interaction with them.

      <li>
        What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating? What is the most satisfying part of the
        interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?
      </li>
      <br />
      <body>
        The siteâ€™s black and white design is really distracting and takes a lot
        of getting used to, this makes it rather frustrating to navigate on
        first use and may deter users from fully exploring the site. However the
        intractable elements mean the user journeys will feel unique and special
        and will definitely make it memorable as an experince.
