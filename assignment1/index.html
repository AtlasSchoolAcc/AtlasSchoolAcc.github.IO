        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </li>
      <body>
        What was immediately clear was that the page has a lot of information
        due to the large amount of elements, Layout wise its disorientating due
        to the margin's not having seperate background colours, My attention was
        drawn to the advent calendar on the left and the opening tabs done by
        left clicking with your mouse.

        Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
        discrete actions.

        -Upon opening the site for the first time I immediately was drawn to the
        advent calendar on the left side of the site. Interacting with it allows
        the user to open the tabs that have moveable elements underneath them.

        -This was followed by reading the text in the center lane of the screen
        that describes the purpose of the sight with a simple title/heading
        followed by body text.
